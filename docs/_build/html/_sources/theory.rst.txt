Incoherent Scattering (Elastic and Inelastic)
==============================================
LEAPR describes incoherent scattering by starting with a continuous (solid-type) distribution and considering additional feautres (e.g. the existence of very sharp peaks or diffusive behavior) if necessary. The continuous calculation *must always be performed*, and additional features that can also be considered include the existence of discrete oscillators (Einstein oscillators), translative/diffusive behavior, cold Hydrogen/Deuterium, and intermolecular interference. 

The continuous calculation will now be discussed, followed by each of the aforementioned features.

Continuous Treatment 
-------------------------

To calculate the incoherent contribution to the scattering law, the following equations must be solved,

.. math::
    S^{(s)}_{n.sym}(\alpha, \beta)=\frac{1}{2 \pi} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \mathrm{e}^{i \beta t} \mathrm{e}^{-\gamma(t)} d t
..   :label: continuousSAB

.. math::
    \gamma(t)=\alpha\lambda_s -\alpha \int_{-\infty}^\infty P(\beta')~\mathrm{e}^{-\beta'/2}~\mathrm{e}^{-i\beta' t}~d\beta'
..    :label: gammaDefinition

.. math:: 
  P(\beta)=\frac{\rho(\beta)}{2\beta\sinh(\beta/2)},
..  :label: PDefinition

where :math:`S^{(s)}_{n.sym}` is the non-symmetric scattering law for solids, :math:`\rho(\beta)` is the phonon frequency distribution, and :math:`\lambda_s` is the Debye-Waller coefficient. 
.. For a introductory discussion on the phonon frequency spectrum, please see :ref:`background_phonon_dos`. 

By Taylor expanding :math:`\gamma(t)`, the above can be simplified to 

.. .. math:: 
    S^{(s)}_{n.sym}(\alpha,\beta) = \mathrm{e}^{-\alpha\lambda_s}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^n}{n!} W_n(\beta)

.. math:: 
    S^{(s)}_{n.sym}(\alpha,\beta) = \mathrm{e}^{-\alpha\lambda_s}\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{\alpha^n\lambda_s^n}{n!} \mathcal{T}_n(\beta)


where


.. math:: 
    \mathcal{T}_1(\beta) = \frac{1}{\lambda_s}P(\beta)~\mathrm{e}^{-\beta/2}\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad \mathcal{T}_n(\beta) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \mathcal{T}_1(\beta')~\mathcal{T}_{n-1}(\beta-\beta')~d\beta'.


.. .. math:: 
    W_1(\beta) = P(\beta)~\mathrm{e}^{-\beta/2}\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad W_n(\beta) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty W_1(\beta')~W_{n-1}(\beta-\beta')~d\beta'.

  **What approximations are made?**
  In describing the scattering behavior with a continuous, solid-type spectrum, a number of approximations are made, which are summarized below.

Translational Behavior
--------------------------------------
Thermal neutron scattering off of liquids can be described by solving a solid-type spectrum that is combined with a diffusive term. A popular diffusive model is the "Effective Width Model", which is defined as 

.. math:: 
  S_{n.sym}^{(t)}(\alpha,\beta) = \frac{2c\omega_t\alpha}{\pi}~\mathrm{exp}\left({2c^2\omega_t\alpha-\beta/2}\right)\sqrt{\frac{c^2+0.25}{\beta^2+4c^2\omega_t^2\alpha^2}}\mathrm{K}_1\left[\sqrt{c^2+0.25}\sqrt{\beta^2+4c^2\omega_t^2\alpha^2}\right]

with a corresponding frequency spectrum

.. math::
  \rho(\beta)=\omega_t\frac{4c}{\pi\beta}\sqrt{c^2+0.25}~\sinh(\beta/2)~\mbox{K}_1\left[\sqrt{c^2+0.25}~\beta\right]

where :math:`K_n(x)` is the modified Bessel function of the second kind with order :math:`n`.


An alternative to the effective width model is the free gas model, which is defined as 

.. math:: 
  S^{(f)}_{n.sym}(\alpha,\beta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\omega_t\alpha}}~\mathrm{exp}\left[-\frac{(\omega_t\alpha+\beta)^2}{4\omega_t\alpha}\right]


So to model a diffusive material, the solid-type solution obtained from the vibrational spectrum is convolved with some appropriate translative model (i.e. effective width model or free gas model).

Discrete Oscillators
-------------------------
The blue region in the below figure shows the vibrational frequency spectrum for hydrogen bound in water [inspired by [CITE DAMIAN]]. Note the two prominent peaks near 0.20 eV and 0.42 eV. If a user wanted to process scattering data for this material, they could provide this full spectrum to LEAPR and have it run the full continuous calculation.

.. figure:: _images/waterPhononDOS_hatch.png
    :width: 90%
    :align: center

    The vibrational frequency spectrum for H bound in water is shown above. 

Alternatively, LEAPR allows for users to represent these higher energy peaks as discrete oscillators, also known as "Einstein oscillators". These oscilltors are represented as weighted Dirac-:math:`\delta` functions in the frequency distribution, which brings the blue distribution in the above figure to become the red distribution. The lower energy, continuous distribution is still the same, but the two higher energy peaks are replaced with weighted :math:`\delta` functions (the weighting is not represented in the above figure).

As can be seen in the figure above, reducing the peaks to simple oscillators eliminates peak resolution and is **only recommended for validating and replicating existing data**. 

The scattering law contribution from a discrete oscillator is

.. math:: 
  S^{(i)}_{n.sym}(\alpha,\beta)=\mathrm{e}^{-\alpha\lambda_i}\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty\delta(\beta-n\beta_i)~I_n\left[\frac{\alpha\omega_i}{\beta_i\sinh(\beta_i/2)}\right]~\mathrm{e}^{-n\beta_i/2}

which is a direct simplification of the scattering law from the continuous case (defined in Eq. [  ]).

To process the scattering law for a material described by discrete oscillators, the discrete ocsillator contribution :math:`S^{(i)}_{n.sym}(\alpha,\beta)` is calcululated for each :math:`i^{th}` oscillator. These individual contributions are convolved with the solid-type contribution :math:`S_{n.sym}^{(s)}(\alpha,\beta)` which, in the figure above corresponds with the lower-energy part of the red distribution.

.. warning::
  **What approximations are made?**
  The discrete oscillator formulation is a simplification of the continuous treatment, and thus adopts those along with additional approximations. Only the additional approximations are presented here.

Coherent Scattering (Elastic)
==============================================

Coherent scattering is when periodic constructive growth or destructive cancellation of the scattered waves occur. This is a difficult phenomena to model, and thus LEAPR is currently limited to describing elastic coherent scattering for the following materials:

  +-----------------+------------------------------+
  | Materials       | Crystalline Structure        |

  | Beryllium Metal | Hexagonal Close-Packed (HCP) |
  +-----------------+------------------------------+
  | Beryllium Oxide | Inter-penetrating HCP        |

  | Aluminum        | Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)    |

  | Lead            | Face-Centered Cubic (FCC)    |
  +-----------------+------------------------------+
  | Iron            | Body-Centered Cubic (BCC)    |

The differential coherent scattering cross section is

.. math:: 
  \sigma_{coh}(E,\mu)=\frac{\sigma_c}{E}\sum_{E_i<E}f_i~\mathrm{e}^{-4W~E_i}~\delta(\mu-\mu_i)

where :math:`W` is the effevtive Debye-Waller coefficient, :math:`\sigma_c` is the bound coherent scattering cross section. :math:`E_i` are Bragg Edges, defined in term

Coherent Scattering (Inelastic) Approximations
================================================

Skold and Vineyard
------------------------

The incoherent approximation, which is made while using the continuous, translational, and discrete oscillator methods, ignores coherent effects. There are some material, however, in which scattered neutron waves can interfere with each other in meaningful ways. This inter-molecular coherence occurs when there is both a significant bound coherent scattering cross section (property of the atoms) as well as some correlation between the positions of nearby molecules (property of the lattice). If these requirements are met, coherent scattering may become non-negligible, at which point its effect can be accounted for by using the **Vineyard** or **Skold** approximations. 

In these methods, the scattering law is separated into a coherent and an incoherent contribution, which are weighted using a *coherent fraction* :math:`c`. The incoherent contribution to the scattering law can be obtained using the aforementioned methods (continuous, discrete, and translational), but the coherent contribution must be approximated.

.. math:: 
  S(\alpha,\beta)=\big(1-c\big)S_{inc}(\alpha,\beta)+c~S_{coh}(\alpha,\beta)


The Skold approximation approximates the coherent scattering law by using the *static structure factor* :math:`S(\kappa)` to modify the incoherent scattering law.

.. math:: 
  S_{coh}(\alpha,\beta)=S_{inc}\left(\frac{\alpha}{S(\kappa)},\beta\right)\times S(\kappa)

The static structure factor :math:`S(\kappa)` is a user-provided input that describes correlation in molecular positions, where :math:`\kappa` is wave number, defined as 

.. math:: 
  \kappa = \frac{\sqrt{2Mk_bT\alpha}}{\hbar}


where :math:`M` is the mass of the scatterer. Using these relations, the coherent-corrected scattering can be obtained by solving the above three equations for all :math:`\alpha,\beta` values.









Cold Hydrogen and Deuterium 
-------------------------------
The continuous treatment equations introduced in :ref:`theory_incoherent_contin` were stated assuming that spins are randomly distributed. This approximation is valid for most materials, but breaks down when describing liquid hydrogen and deuterium. To correct this error, quantum mechanical treatment is required to account for spin-spin correlations for atoms in the same molecule/structure.

For the remainder of this discussion, "hydrogen" will refer to the element, i.e. both :math:`^1\mathrm{H}` and :math:`^2\mathrm{D}`. 

For describing the spin-spin correlation for hydrogen, two cases are considered: *ortho* and *para*. Ortho hydrogen indicates that the spins of the nuclei are in the same direction, whereas para hydrogen indicates that the spins are in opposite direction.


.. figure:: _images/orthoVsPara.png
    :width: 40%
    :align: center

    Ortho and para describe the alignment of the spins that can occur in a pair of hydrogens. Ortho corresponds to the spins going in the same direction, whereas para corresponds to them going in the opposite direction. 


There are two different scattering law equations that describe cold hydrogen scattering, depending on the relative spin directions (ortho and para).


.. math::
  S_{n.sym}^{ortho}(\alpha,\beta)=\sum_{J~odd} \frac{P_J4\pi}{\sigma_b}\Big[ A_{ortho}\sum_{J'~even}F(J,J') + B_{ortho}\sum_{J'~odd} F(J,J') \Big]

.. math::
  S_{n.sym}^{para}(\alpha,\beta)=\sum_{J~even} \frac{P_J4\pi}{\sigma_b}\Big[ A_{para}\sum_{J'~even}F(J,J') + B_{para}\sum_{J'~odd} F(J,J') \Big]

.. math::
  F(J,J')=\big(2J'+1\big)~S_f(\omega\alpha,\beta+\beta_{JJ'})\sum_{l=\left|J'-J\right|}^{J'+J}4j_l^2(y)C^2(JJ'l;00)

Special Cases and Misc. Functions
==============================================

Short-collision time approximation 
------------------------------------
When calculating the contribution of incoherent scattering via use of the *phonon expansion*, values corresponding to significant change in momentum (i.e. large :math:`\alpha` values) can become costly to calculate. To avoid prohibitively costly calculations, LEAPR employs the **short-collision time approximation (SCT)** to describe scattering in a solid for these conditions of large momentum transfer. The SCT approximation is defined as 

.. math::
  S(\alpha,-\beta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{4\pi\alpha w_s \overline{T}/T}}~\mathrm{exp}\left[-\frac{(\alpha w_s-\beta)^2}{\alpha w_s\overline{T}/T}\right]
  
and

.. math::
  S(\alpha,\beta)=\mathrm{e}^{-\beta}~S(\alpha,\beta)


where the effective temperature :math:`\overline{T}` is defined as 

.. math:: 
  \overline{T}=\frac{T}{2w_s}\int_{-\infty}^\infty\beta^2P(\beta)\mathrm{e}^{-\beta}~d\beta

and :math:`w_s` is the weight for the continuous, solid-type spectrum.


.. The SCT approximation is found to work "well for large incident neutron energies when the duration of a collision is short compared with the natural periods of atomic motion" [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc1089525/m2/1/high_res_d/5508404.pdf] [THE SHORT COLLISION TIME APPROXIMATION FOR NEUTRON SCATTERING USING DISCRETE FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION by Ryskamp]  "For large incident neutron energies the duration of a collison is short compared with the natural periods of atomic motion."
