NJOY input files are able to call multiple modules in sequence, which can be used together to perform complicated manipulations of the nuclear data. Broadly speaking, an NJOY input file will be structured as follows.

.. literalinclude:: exampleInputs/genericInput
  :language: html

Here, the first module name is specified, and the inputs are divided into "cards" (i.e. lines) of inputs. Each module has its own number of possible card, and each card has its own number of inputs. 

Modules in NJOY are rarely called in isolation, as they require the output of some other module as input. LEAPR, however, can be called alone, as it does not require any auxiliary input files (just the input file is sufficient to call LEAPR). THERMR requires that an input PENDF be provided, which can originate from earlier NJOY modules.

**Card 1**

.. literalinclude:: exampleInputs/simple
   :language: html
   :lines: 1-4

After specifying the module (THERMR), the input and output files are stated. Here, thermal scattering input (which is the output from LEAPR) is tape24, and the PENDF (which could come from RECONR and BROADR, for example) is in tape23. THERMR will write its output file to tape25.
  

.. .. glossary::
    nendf 
        Thermal scattering input, which is the output from LEAPR. nendf can be set to zero if no LEAPR run is performed prior to this calculation, but doing so does limit THERMR's capabilities. In the directory that NJOY is run, nendf should appear as "tape24"
    nin
        Input PENDF file, which can be obtained from (for example) RECONR and BROADR. This should be available in the NJOY bin directory as "tape23".
    nout
        Desired output file to which THERMR will write the final PENDF. Here, it's "tape25"

**Card 2**

.. literalinclude:: exampleInputs/simple
   :language: html
   :lines: 1-15

The ``matde`` value is set to be 1, which corresponds to light water. The full list of material ID number is available in the current ENDF manual. ``matdp`` equals 125, which is the ENDF-B/VIII.0 MAT number for H-1. Thus, these two values indicate that this THERMR run is for :math:`\mbox{H}` bound :math:`\mbox{H}_2\mbox{O}`.

We ask for two angular bins, which means that the scattering distribution for inelastic and incoherent elastic scattering will be split into two equi-probable cosines. One temperature is requested, which means that there should only be one value in the temperature card (Card 3). ``iin`` is set to 2, meaning that we will read the scattering law :math:`S(\alpha,\beta)` off of the ``nendf`` tape, and convert it to an inelastic scattering distribution. Following ``iin`` is the ``iform`` flag, which dictates the ordering that will be used for inelastic scattering distributions (``iform`` set to 0 means :math:`E,E',\mu` ordering). Elastic calculation control is set by ``icoh``, which is 0 here (meaning that no elastic calculation is necessary).
